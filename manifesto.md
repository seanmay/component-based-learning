# Architecture for Component-Based Learning

### Rules for Component-Based Learning Architecture may be Seen as Follows
- Components should strive to provide digestible chunks of functional (hands-on, practical, applicable) understanding with minimal barrier of entry, beyond declared dependencies  

- Components should strive to have example code of the appropriate granularity to demonstrate either usage or implementation, as appropriate  

- Components should strive to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle, even if that Component becomes a 5-minute talk on integrating `A`, `B` and `C` (eg: "Putting it all together")  

- Components should strive to clearly define and declare dependencies on other Components  

- Components should strive to combine all technologies and concepts relevant to the unit being presented  

- Components should strive to clearly cite the underlying features/technologies introduced, and where possible, cite reference material  

- Components __should not__ be viewed as equivalent to "training modules", but rather topics, talking points, or examples; they are the building blocks of higher-order learning  

- Components __should not__ be primitive elements of what you are teaching, but rather structures comprised thereof, and the value they offer; if there are dependencies on another layer of understanding, then first define the dependencies in that layer, and be certain that any unmet dependencies are being covered


### Rules for Composing A Learning Engagement may be Seen as Follows
- assess the consumer's goals (ie: ___needs___) from a business perspective; what do they want to accomplish with their new knowledge? If this is for an article, or a video, a strawman or a poll may be appropriate  

- engagements should be comprised of the components (and any unmet lower-level dependencies) which will help meet the previously defined needs

- engagements and learning with Components should be hands-on and example/exercise-driven, where possible

- higher-level Components may be a composite of both lower-level dependencies and previously learned Components
